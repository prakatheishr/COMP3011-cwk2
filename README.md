# COMP3011 Coursework 2 — Web Crawler Search Tool

This project implements a command-line search tool for `quotes.toscrape.com`.

The application crawls the website, extracts quote content, builds an inverted index, saves the index to disk, and allows users to search the indexed pages using an interactive shell.

## Features

- Crawls paginated pages from `quotes.toscrape.com`
- Enforces a 6-second politeness delay between requests
- Extracts quote text, authors, and tags
- Builds a case-insensitive inverted index
- Stores word frequency and token position statistics
- Saves and loads the index using JSON
- Supports single-word and multi-word search
- Provides an interactive CLI shell
- Includes formal pytest coverage for crawler, indexer, search, and integration behaviour

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- pip

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

Run from the project root using module mode:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

Do not run using `python src/main.py`, because the project uses package-style imports such as `src.crawler`.

## CLI Commands
```bash
text
build
load
print <word>
find <query>
help
exit
```

## Example Command Flow
```bash
build
print life
find life
find good friends
load
print life
find good friends
help
exit
```

## Command Descriptions

| Command | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `build` | Crawls the website, builds the inverted index, saves it to `data/index.json`, and keeps it in memory |
| `load` | Loads the saved index from `data/index.json` |
| `print <word>` | Prints the inverted index entry for a word, including frequency and positions |
| `find <query>` | Returns pages containing all query terms |
| `help` | Displays available commands |
| `exit` | Exits the shell |

---

## Search Behaviour

Search is case-insensitive.

The same tokenizer is used during both indexing and searching:
- text is lowercased  
- punctuation is removed  
- words are split on whitespace  

Multi-word queries use page-set intersection. For example:

```text
find good friends
```

returns only pages that contain both ```good``` and ```friends```.

### Result Ranking

As an extension beyond the core requirements, search results are ranked using a simple TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) scoring method.

This means:
- pages where query terms appear more frequently are ranked higher  
- pages containing more distinctive (less common) terms are prioritised  

Because the inverted index already stores term frequency and document frequency, this ranking is implemented as an additional scoring layer without modifying the underlying index structure.

## Index Structure

The inverted index stores each term with:

- document frequency  
- page URLs  
- per-page frequency  
- token positions  

### Example Structure

```python
{
    "life": {
        "document_frequency": 2,
        "pages": {
            "page1": {
                "frequency": 3,
                "positions": [0, 4, 8]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Running Tests

Run all formal tests:

```bash
pytest tests/test_crawler.py tests/test_indexer.py tests/test_search.py tests/test_integration.py -v
```

## The Test Suite Covers

- crawler parsing and pagination  
- request failure handling  
- politeness delay logic  
- tokenization  
- inverted index construction  
- index persistence  
- search logic  
- CLI handler integration  

---

## Design Decisions

### Crawler

The crawler is split into small functions:

- `fetch_page`  
- `parse_page`  
- `find_next_page`  
- `crawl_site`  

This makes the crawler easier to test and explain.

---

### Politeness

A 6-second delay is enforced between successive requests to avoid overloading the target website.

---

### Inverted Index

The index stores frequency and position statistics to support the required `print <word>` command and future search extensions.

---

### Multi-word Query Definition

Multi-word queries return only pages that contain **all query terms**, implemented using page-set intersection.

---

### Persistence

The index is saved as JSON because it is simple, readable, and easy to inspect during testing or demonstration.

---

### Search

Multi-word search uses intersection between page sets, meaning all query terms must appear on a page for it to be returned.

---

## Edge Cases Handled

- loading before an index file exists  
- printing before an index is loaded  
- searching before an index is loaded  
- empty commands  
- invalid commands  
- missing words  
- empty queries  
- punctuation-heavy queries  
- repeated search terms  
- malformed page records  
- request timeouts and HTTP errors

## GenAI Usage Declaration

Generative AI was used as a development support tool for planning, code structure suggestions, debugging guidance, and reflection. All generated suggestions were reviewed, tested, and adapted manually.
